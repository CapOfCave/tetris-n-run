You are trying to escape the building you happen to be trapped inside of. There is only one problem: You cannot touch the floor and are only able move by using so-called Tetros with which you need to build your path to exit.
You can place Tetros by dragging them out of your inventory into the level. Rotate Tetros by pressing the right mouse button or <5> on your keyboard. The last Tetro placed can be removed by pressing <6>.
When reaching a new checkpoint, you obtain new Tetros to use in the following part. Your progress is saved, even after exiting the level or the game and can be loaded in the overworld.
If you want to retry the current passage, press <8> or walk to a specific checkpoint and interact with it to load the previous progress. You might need to load a previous checkpoint without being able to reach it. In those cases, press <10> to delete the last Checkpoint, followed by pressing <8>.
You can find different Objects to use by pressing <4>: Levers that either close or open doors of the same color, or buttons that spawn a movable block. You can interact with a block from an adjacent tile when looking in its direction.
This block can be grabbed with <4> and then pushed through the level, for example onto a pressure plate. However, you can only push and never pull it.
If you need a better overview, you can hold <7> and move the camera. You cannot place Tetros in camera mode though.
That should be enough from our side - you need to figure out the rest by yourself in order to solve the puzzles and to reach the exit
